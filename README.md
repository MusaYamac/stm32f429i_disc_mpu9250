# stm32f429i_disc_mpu9250
**stm32f429zi discovery board.** This projects reads the raw data from IMU (mpu9250 or mpu 6050), filters the raw data and evaluates yaw, pitch and roll angles. Using UART, it also prints the meaningful orientation data to the screen.

I'll share a project at which IMU data will be displayed on the lcd screen of the board.

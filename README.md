# stm32f429i_disc_mpu9250
This projects reads the raw data from IMU (mpu9250 or mpu 6050), filters the raw data to evaluate yaw, pitch and roll angles. Using UART, it also prints the meaningful data to the screen on stm32f429zi discovery board. 

I'll share a project at which IMU data will be printed on the lcd screen of the board.
